## Questions(KPI)

•	What is the average heart rate across users?<br>
•	What is the average calories burned per user?<br>
•	What is the average workout duration?<br>
•	What is the average calories burned compared to total calories?<br>
•	How does heart rate relate to body weight and calories burned?<br>
•	What are the trends in workout duration by workout type?<br>
•	How does heart rate vary by intensity levels?<br>
•	What is the relationship between intensity and calories burned across weekday types?<br>
•	How are users distributed by intensity and workout duration?<br>
•	How does weekday vs. weekend workout duration differ?<br>
•	What is the average calories burned daily?<br>
•	Many More…..<br>

## Process
•	Gathered raw fitness tracking data with various fields. Removed duplicates and null values.<br>
•	Standardized workout types (Running, Cycling, Yoga, Strength).<br>
•	Created calculated fields (e.g., Avg Calories Burned, Avg Workout Duration). Categorized data (Weekday vs Weekend, Intensity levels).<br>
•	Built relationships between user, workout, and activity tables.<br>
•	Created DAX measures (e.g., Total Steps, Avg Calories Burned, Steps Trend).<br>
•	Then Created various visuals and Grouped dashboards by analysis theme: Workout Type, Intensity, and Gender.<br>
