•	How does heart rate vary by intensity levels?
•	What is the relationship between intensity and calories burned across weekday types?
•	How are users distributed by intensity and workout duration?
•	How does weekday vs. weekend workout duration differ?
•	What is the average calories burned daily?
•	Many More…..

##Process
•	Gathered raw fitness tracking data with various fields. Removed duplicates and null values.
•	Standardized workout types (Running, Cycling, Yoga, Strength).
•	Created calculated fields (e.g., Avg Calories Burned, Avg Workout Duration). Categorized data (Weekday vs Weekend, Intensity levels).
•	Built relationships between user, workout, and activity tables.
•	Created DAX measures (e.g., Total Steps, Avg Calories Burned, Steps Trend).
•	Then Created various visuals and Grouped dashboards by analysis theme: Workout Type, Intensity, and Gender.
