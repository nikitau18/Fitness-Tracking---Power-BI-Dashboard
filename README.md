# Fitness Tracking- Power BI Dashboard

## Project Objective

Created a fitness tracking dashboard with interactive visuals for activity monitoring.  Showcased trends in steps, calories, heart rate, and workout types.  Designed insights to make fitness tracking simple, data-driven, and actionable.

## Dataset Used
-<a href="https://github.com/nikitau18/Fitness-Tracking---Power-BI-Dashboard/blob/main/fitness%20tracking.xlsx"> Dataset</a>

## Questions(KPI)

•	What is the average heart rate across users?<br>
•	What is the average calories burned per user?<br>
•	What is the average workout duration?<br>
•	What is the average calories burned compared to total calories?<br>
•	How does heart rate relate to body weight and calories burned?<br>
•	What are the trends in workout duration by workout type?<br>
•	How does heart rate vary by intensity levels?<br>
•	What is the relationship between intensity and calories burned across weekday types?<br>
•	How are users distributed by intensity and workout duration?<br>
•	How does weekday vs. weekend workout duration differ?<br>
•	What is the average calories burned daily?<br>
•	Many More…..<br>

## Process
•	Gathered raw fitness tracking data with various fields. Removed duplicates and null values.<br>
•	Standardized workout types (Running, Cycling, Yoga, Strength).<br>
•	Created calculated fields (e.g., Avg Calories Burned, Avg Workout Duration). Categorized data (Weekday vs Weekend, Intensity levels).<br>
•	Built relationships between user, workout, and activity tables.<br>
•	Created DAX measures (e.g., Total Steps, Avg Calories Burned, Steps Trend).<br>
•	Then Created various visuals and Grouped dashboards by analysis theme: Workout Type, Intensity, and Gender.<br>

## Project Insights
•	Running & Strength workouts generated the highest steps, showing they are more step-intensive compared to Yoga & Cycling.
•	High-intensity workouts resulted in the maximum calories burned, but also showed higher heart rate spikes, which may need monitoring for certain users.
•	Weekend workouts had a longer average duration compared to weekdays, indicating users are more consistent and active during weekends.
•	Male and female users showed nearly balanced step counts, but calorie burn distribution varied by workout type (e.g., males preferred strength training, females engaged more in yoga).
•	Workout intensity analysis revealed that medium-intensity workouts contributed the most sustainable calorie burn without excessive heart rate rise.

## Final Conclusion
Analysis showed that workout intensity and type are key drivers of calorie burn, with weekends seeing higher engagement.
Findings highlight the need for personalized plans and motivation strategies to improve fitness consistency.
